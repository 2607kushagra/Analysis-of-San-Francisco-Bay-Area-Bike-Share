****Dataset:****
We conduct analysis on the San Francisco Bay Area Bike Share dataset. The dataset weighs in at 2 GB. The
dataset provides information on the reasonably priced, quick, and simple bike excursions in and around
the San Francisco Bay Area. It includes details on the designated stations for picking up and dropping off
bikes, the number of bikes and docks that are available, individual bike trips, and the weather forecast for
a certain day for a given zip code.


****Business Understanding:****
Data from the Bay Area Bike Share System is included in the collection. The San Francisco Municipal
Transportation Agency (SFMTA) launched the Bay Area Bike Share System in 2013 to provide the general
public with accessible and reasonably priced transportation. SFMTA gathered information on the trips
made by users from various places in order to gain a better understanding of how the Bay Area Bike
Share System is used.
In addition to understanding commute patterns in the San Francisco area, we are using this data to assess
other Bay Area Bike Share system aspects. The average trip duration, number of bikes available at a
specific location and time, average temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other weather-related
variables on each day of the trip, as well as the latitude and longitude of the station locations, can all be
determined using this data. It can also be used to track bike patterns depending on the day of the week
and time.
After the study, different conclusions might be taken from this dataset. The Bay Area Bike Share system's
effectiveness can be increased by determining the ideal time, place, and weather condition factors. For
instance, if the weather is favorable and the peak usage hours have been recorded, the number of bikes
provided to a certain station may be increased. It is possible to completely remove the bike-share
program from the system if it is not being utilized as frequently at a specific station.
In order to increase the availability of bikes and docks at various stations, this analysis will look at popular
routes, how the weather affects the use of bike-share services and demand patterns for excursions that
may be made on two wheels throughout the day and week. The average travel time can be shortened,
the number of bikes at busy stations can be increased, and the optimal temperature and time can be
checked to modify the supply chain of bikes accordingly. These are all things that can be maximized after
analyzing this data.
We intend to obtain comprehensive data regarding the ratio of subscribers to customers at a specific
station at the conclusion of the analysis. We will investigate the best area to advertise in order to turn
customers into subscribers. It would be necessary to increase the number of bikes and docks available at
stations with strong demand. Which season of the year has the lowest demand and is best for carrying
out maintenance work?
